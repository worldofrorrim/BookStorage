    "As editor of the [Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/jargon) and author of a few other well-known documents of similar nature,I often get email requests from enthusiastic network newbies asking (in effect) \"how can I learn to be a wizardly hacker?\". Back in 1996 I noticed that there didn't seem to be any other FAQs or web documents that addressed this vital question,so I started this one. A lot of hackers now consider it definitive,and Isuppose that means it is. Still,I don't claim to be the exclusive authority on this topic;if you don't like what you read here,write you own.\n",
